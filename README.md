Things I still want to add:

> And frame functionality.
> Extract dominant colors out of an image: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEYap1mupUQ
> Add time and other text to image.
> Add AI's description of the photo
> code that will find paintings of the same dominant color and arrange them around the image.
